            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="par">Wola Nani's serious mission of caring for the infected and affected persons living with HIV and AIDS has always been carried out with activities like painting the town red by wrapping building in giant<br> 
                ribbons or lighting up table mountain on World Aids Day. Nowadays, with more awareness than before Wola Nani lies its mission of caring through counseling and testing; ARV adherence counseling<br>
                and support, after school programmes for vulnerable children and income generation opportunities for persons with HIV and AIDS. Most recently Wola Nani launched a Research and Training Institute<br>
                which seeks to develop good practice models which Wola Nani can share with the HIV sector at large, including government, donors and partner organisations.</p>

                <h2>WOLA NANI CHILDREN'S PROGRAMME</h2>
                <p class="par">Since the inception of the organization, Wola Nani has always recognized that children are the most vulnerable in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They are either infected or affected, through being orphaned<br>
                    by AIDS and driven into further vulnerability by poverty and lack of food and shelter. With the support of our donors, Wola Nani was able to substantially enhance its Child Program and embark
                    on moving them from “vulnerability to resilience”.<br>
                    Since 2007, more donors have come on board and this program is growing fast, providing after school activities to just under 400 children, their parents/caregivers and other members of the household.<br>
                    
                    <br>The program focuses on children aged from 7 to 18 years. Recruitment and selection is based on the following additional factors:
                    
                    <li>Orphaned children with the greatest social and financial need.</li>
                    <li>Children not linked with the Social Services Grant system.</li>
                    <li>Children with a traceable physical address.</li>
                    <li>Children who will be able to participate in a holistic service program which includes nutritional support, education and play.</li>
                    <li>Children currently on HAART.</li><br>
                    The geographic areas of focus are currently Mfuleni, Khayelitsha and Phillipi.</p>
