            <p class="par">It all starts with knowing your status, we want to encourage this bold step free of stigma as the first action
                to taking control of one's life and arming one's self with the information required.
                
                If you would like to find out your HIV status you can visit your doctor or a local clinic or a non – medical HIV testing
                site. In South Africa, patient confidentiality around HIV means your doctor can not discuss or disclose your HIV status
                to anyone else without your prior permission.
                
                However, if you would feel more comfortable, there are a number of freely available services providing discreet and confidential
                counseling and testing that you can access.</p>
