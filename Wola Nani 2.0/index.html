            <h1>Wola Nani</h1>
            <p class="par">Wola Nani, Xhosa for 'we embrace and develop one another', was established in 1994 as a non-profit<br>
                           organisation to help bring relief to the communities hardest hit by the HIV crisis. It is within the<br>
                           context of South Africa having the largest burden of HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa that Wola Nani<br>
                           works towards its vision of seeing the quality of life of persons living with HIV and Aids improved<br>
                           to an extent that they are living positively, with hope.<br><br>
            
                Wola Nani was first founded by human rights activist, Gary Lamont, here he speaks of why<br> 
                in 1994 he decided to start Wola Nani:<br>

                "After the 1994 elections HIV became the issue. South African black women and children,they<br>
                had nothing. They were poor, illiterate, lacked transport and had no real community in the<br>
                townships as they had come from rural areas. They were nowhere near having ‘a voice'. We wanted<br> 
                to provide services for those who couldn't help themselves. It was a physical expression of<br>
                the new South Africa. We were on a roll from the end of apartheid – altruistic, energetic and full of ideas".</p>

                            ravages of diseases such as malaria. It is devastating families and communities, depleting health
                            care resources and robbing schools of both students and teachers."</i><br>
