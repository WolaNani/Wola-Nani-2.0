            <p class="par">There are lots of ways you can get involved in Wola Nani. Wola Nani is not only seeking financial support. We are looking to strengthen and improve our infrastructure in order to run as effectively<br>
                as possible and maximize our services in the community. There are many ways our team could benefit from additional support. If you believe you may be able to contribute valuable<br> 
                skills and experience, and can spare a little time, even simply teaching a staff member to drive, please contact us.<br><br>
                
                If you would like to support our efforts but are not sure how you can help, please don't underestimate the impact of simply wearing a red ribbon. Your open and thoughtful gesture will be warmly<br>
                welcomed and appreciated by the many people affected by HIV.</p>
